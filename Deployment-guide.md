# Deployment guide

## Prerequisites

To begin, you will need:

- Power Apps and Power Automate (seeded licenses) enabled and rolled out across your organisation.
- Power Apps environment with a Dataverse database deployed (only required due to the solution using Environment Variables). You may use the default environment, however a production environment is recommended. If you do not have capacity to create a Dataverse database, you may need to use the default environment. 
- Service account (optional) to deploy the Power App and Flows, if you do not wish to create a service account then an ordinary user with Environment Maker permissions is adequate.
- Access to the Power Apps environment you wish to deploy to (Environment Maker) access.
