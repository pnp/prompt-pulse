Prompt Pulse is a Power App that enables users and administrators to efficiently schedule and manage the sharing of Copilot prompts across Microsoft Teams, group chats, and individual users within an organization.

Assist your organization in mastering the art of prompting to fully utilize Microsoft 365 Copilot.

Microsoft 365 Copilot introduces a novel approach to work, and success is achieved when it becomes habitual to employ Copilot's assistance throughout the workday.
 
Team members can establish these new routines by actively exchanging and embracing fresh prompts in 'Prompt Pulse', which illustrates whatâ€™s possible and motivates them to refine their prompting techniques.
 
Utilizing Power Automate, these prompts are automatically distributed to Teams chats/channels or Viva Engage based on scheduled timings for regular and reliable updates.

'Prompt Pulse' features a user-friendly interface designed with Power Apps, enabling admins to set schedules, designate specific audiences, and track the distribution of prompts.
 
Deployment is straightforward and quick, not necessitating any premium connectors nor relying on Dataverse.
