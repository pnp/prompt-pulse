Prompt Pulse enables users and administrators to efficiently schedule and manage the sharing of Copilot prompts across Microsoft Teams, group chats, and individual users within an organization. Leveraging Power Automate, users can automate the dissemination of these prompts based on predefined schedules, ensuring timely and consistent communication. The solution also includes an intuitive interface built on Power Apps, where administrators can configure schedules, select target recipients, and monitor prompt delivery. This streamlined process enhances collaboration and productivity by ensuring that valuable insights and reminders are shared seamlessly across the organization.
